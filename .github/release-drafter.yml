# Note: because of escaping logic inside of release drafter our regex should be escaped correctly and drafter wil un-escape it internally
# - Escaped regex: When writing a regular expression as a string in code, special characters like (, ), and : need to be escaped with a backslash (\) because these characters have special meanings in regex.
# - Unescaped regex: If you use a raw regex literal (i.e., surrounded by slashes /.../), the regex engine interprets it directly, and you don’t need to double-escape the special characters.
